Hands-on session: Introduction to Docker


You'll need some setup before the session:

1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/mefjush/docker-workshop

2. Get Docker. You've got 2 options here:
   a) either install it directly on your PC: 
      https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/
      https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/
      https://docs.docker.com/windows/started/

   b) or use this Vagrant box: 
      https://github.com/mefjush/docker-workshop/tree/master/vagrant

3. (Optional) Get Docker-compose 
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
